Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Keza Teta Keffa Lyssa. I am a passionate learner currently pursuing the ALX Pathway program, focusing on business finance, venture creation, and computer engineering. I'm originally from Rwanda and I’m committed to creating solutions that improve lives in my community.

I’m particularly interested in technology, international trade, and climate change solutions. Through this learning journey, I hope to sharpen my problem-solving and coding skills, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and bring impactful ideas to life.
